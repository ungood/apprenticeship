Assignment #1 - first commit in github

First things first.  We'll need a better way to communicate and comment on code than email.
That's where github comes in. Github is a public git host, and git is a popular (and free)
version control system (VCS).A version control system is useful for storing anything that
changes over time, keeping a backup of your code (so you don't lose it if your hard drive crashes)
as well as a history of all changes (so you can experiment without fear, being able to rollback
to a previous "savepoint" if you want).  In addition, VCSes handle merges - what happens when
two people modify the same file at the same time - which is immensely important if you're working
on a team.  And we can kill a few birds with one stone - have a simple way to communicate code
changes, learn some basic linux skills, and learn at least one version control system at the same time.

* Create github.com account
* Install git (specifically, msysgit, a version of git for windows)
  * https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git
  * From here out, try to use "git bash" which is a command-line interface for most things - some useful commands:
    * pwd (print working directory) - see your current directory
    * ls - list files in current directory
    * cd - change directory (.. is the name of the parent directory)
    * mkdir - make directory
    * vim - vim is a popular file editor, we'll be learning it in a bit.
* Create a repository
  * https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo
  * Learn a bit about git: http://try.github.io/
  * Make me (ungood) a collaborator in github for that repo so I can edit it.
    * Collaborator settings are in the settings tab in teh github UI.
* Once you've done the above, edit this file (first.md) with a link to the repository you created in github.

Then we'll begin the second "assignment"

In the meantime, read a bit about C++, Java, and C#.  We'll want to pick a language to use for future assignments.
* C++ you already know a bit about, and while it is very important, it is somewhat cumbersome and is being
  used less and less in the real world.
* Java is a good pragramatic choice and based on C++, but it is falling a bit behind in terms of features
  compared to C#.  It is, however, used in tons of places (Amazon included).
* C# is a Microsoft-designed language, and you're already familiar with the IDE (Visual Studio).  It's got
  quite a good syntax, and some nice new features.

Other choices if you'd like to try something new could be python, ruby, or javascript.  A good programmer
learns as many languages as he can.

"Extra Credit"
--------------
* Fork a repository: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo
* Search github for a project that interests you (there are tons: games, math, science, what have you), fork it
  and clone it on your computer
